Test package in testpypi
========================

Use Testpypi in MacOS.
----------------------

Before distributing to pypi, we should first test those packages in testpypi.

Developer can follow following instruction to upload package to testpypi

 1. Register in testpypi.

 2. In Account setting, Add API tokens.

 3. Include necessary files in MANIFEST.in.

 4. Creating pyproject.toml.
    pyproject.toml is the file that tells build tools what system you are using and what it required for building.

 5. Build distribution archives

    ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

    ``CC=gcc python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel``

    Compilers other than gcc can also be used.

 6. Upload the distribution archives

    ``pip install setuptools twine``

    ``python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*``

 7. Create a clean environment and download the distribution archives


    ``CC=gcc pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple svmbir``

    Compilers other than gcc can also be used.
